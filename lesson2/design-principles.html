      <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
      <p>Yale School of Art</p>
      <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu" target="_blank">art.yale.edu</a>
      <img src="images/yaleart.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the home page for the Yale School of Art website.">
      <p>I chose the website for Yale School of Art because of its poor use of padding and white space. The school's
        address is split between several
        elements. Each element (spans with breaks) has no padding between the text and the perimeter of the element. The
        headline does not have any padding between the text and the perimeter. The lack of padding is very distracting
        to me. It
        feels like I have to concentrate very hard on reading the words on the webpage. There is space between some of
        the elements but the background
        color makes it look like there is no spacing. The line spacing is not wide enough which limits the white space
        within the text areas.

      <h3>Proximity</h3>
      <p>Arngren</p>
      <a href="https://arngren.net" target="_blank">arngren.net</a>
      <img src="images/arngren.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the home page for the Arngren website.">
      <p>This is a Norwegian e-commerce website which appears to be mixture of Craig's List and a promotional flyer for
        a store like Harbor Freight.
        This is a very poor example of proximity. There is no space between the images or other elements. It is hard to
        determine which direction
        the author of the page intended the user to read. It is also hard to tell which prices are for what item. The
        layout of the page does encourage
        me to purchase anything. It seems like someone just randomly dropped images onto on a webpage and filled some
        gaps with a little text. It also
        has no white space which is part of proper use of proximity.

      <h3>Contrast</h3>
      <p>Gates N Fences</p>
      <a href="http://gatesnfences.com" target="_blank">gatesnfences.com</a>
      <img src="images/gatesnfences.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the home page for the Gates N Fences website.">
      <p>The Gates N Fences website is good example of poor contrast. It is hard to see, but the middle photo of the
        three gates has text within the
        boundaries of the photo. The font is small and white with the photo as a background. Some of the text is on the
        light area of the photo causing
        poor contrast between the font and photo. The Wave tool states that the contrast is 2.46:1 for the photo and
        text. This font appears to be smaller
        than 14 so the contrast requirement would be 4.5:1. In my opinion, they need to remove the text from the photo
        and create a figure caption
        element to store the text for each photo. The font size needs to be increased. The contrast for the buttons on
        the left side bar needs to be
        improved. The background of the buttons have a light streak that causes poor contrast between the button and the
        text.
