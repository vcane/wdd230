        <h3>Mission and Goals</h3>
        <p>
          The mission of the Chamber is to build a strong network among the companies that conduct business in Topeka,
          promote business in our city, and attract new businesses to join our ranks. We believe Topeka is the best
          place
          to have a business because of the business friendly and family friendly atmosphere in the city. Topeka is a
          medium-sized city with numerous smaller towns in the surrounding area of northeast Kansas and easy access to
          the
          Kansas City metropolitan area. Our city attracts many consumers from the surrounding towns. Also, our
          top-notch
          schools and neighborhoods provide good opportunities for raising and educating families. We have a large and
          well-known university, Washburn University, and several smaller higher education institutions. Our current
          goals
          are as follows:
        </p>
        <img src="images/unity.webp" alt="Hands of four people grabbing each other's wrist to make a square.">
        <ol class="lists">
          <li>Plan and execute six small gatherings on a bimonthly schedule throughout the year. The small gatherings
            will
            enable business leaders and representatives to gather in informal environment to discuss ideas and concerns
            and promote networking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan and execute an annual conference to give the state of business in our city. A special guest will be
            invited to speak at the conference. The conference will be advertised in several regions to promote
            networking
            between our businesses and businesses in the other cities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan and execute an annual business and trade show with Visit Topeka to promote businesses in our area. The
            show will be open to the public so the companies can educate the attendees about their products and
            services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan and execute two community events with the Parks and Recreation department. One event will be a 5K which
            local businesses can help sponsor and collect money for the local food pantries. A second event will be a
            free
            concert held at Evergy Plaza in downtown Topeka. Both events will be family friendly to promote unity
            amongst
            our members and the community of Topeka.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increase our membership by 100 businesses or individuals and maintain our current membership partners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Promote our city by developing and implementing an incentive program to attract new businesses to our city.
            The current idea is to work with the city council to adopt a tax credit plan that will provide credits based
            on the number of employees in the business and the type of business.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement a business promotion program where our Executive Committee will vote on three companies to
            highlight
            for each month. The three companies will be highlighted on the home page of our website.
