    <h2>Welcome To Topeka, Kansas!</h2>
    <p>Topeka is the capitol city of Kansas and located within Shawnee County in northeast Kansas. It has a population
      of 126,587 people according to the 2020 census, which makes it the fifth largest city in Kansas. In our opinion,
      that makes Topeka the best city to live in. It has a lot to do for recreation but it is not too big. The city
      located along the Kansas River in the rolling hills of northeast Kansas just east of the beautiful Flint Hills.

        The first European inhabitants of the area were the French-Canadian Pappan brothers who married three
        half-Kansas Indian sisters. The families established a ferry for wagons to cross the Kansas River along the
        Oregon Trail at what is now known as Topeka. The first use of the name Topeka is acredited to a mixed-blood
        Native American named Joesph James (Joejim). In 1854, the city was laid out and then chartered in 1857.

        It was founded as a Free-State city by anti-slavery easterners immediately after the passage of the
        Nebraska-Kansas bill. The city was under siege at one time by pro-slavery settlers. The anti-slavery and
        pro-slavery conflicts in the area lasted through the Civil War era. Eventually, the anti-slavery movement
        established itself well enough to hold the area and protect freed slaves traveling on the Underground Railroad.
        The city is well-known for the U.S.Supreme Court case Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, which overturned
        Plessy vs. Ferguson and declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional.
