    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience will primarily be adults. The expected primary users will be people looking 
      for a reliable and accurate information covering their town and surrounding county areas. 
      We also expect to have users with a wide range of experience with technology. Therefore, the website will need to be 
      user friendly for people with little experience with technology. The median age of the three counties is about 36 years
      old. The median income is approximately $57,000 annually. With this information, we expect most of our users to come
      from households with adults and young children. We expect that they will be looking for events which are family friendly.
